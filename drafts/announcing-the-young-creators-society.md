#Announcing the Young Creators Society

Hello there! I am excited to announce a new project, the Young Creators Society.

The Young Creators Society is a website, a community. A place for young designers and developers to learn, share, and teach one another. 

The website will consist of articles, tutorials, and other content. The articles will be high-quality, educational material aimed towards the “young” demographic.

But what is “young?” We aren’t trying to exclude anybody. We mean young in experience, not in physical age. Our content will be focused towards the beginners, the noobs, the ones trying to find their way in the crazy world of the internet.

The one feature that I am most excited about is Interviews. We will be interviewing more established designers and developers. We want to give our users a new perspective, and advice from role models and elders can be invaluable at this point in a young person’s career.

###But wait, there’s more!

In addition to showering our users with high-quality content and interviews, we will also be creating a community side to the site. This will take the form of a message board/forum, a place where users can communicate with one another. Users will be able to get feedback, collaborate on projects, and discuss our craft and the things we all have in common.

We hope that this community will grow into a friendly and welcoming place. A place where young designers and developers will feel comfortable being themselves. We want to create an environment where our users can learn, share, and teach with one another.
